    <!--  The first are
        those that act directly on elements defined in the document tree (p elements
        and href attributes, for example); this category contains class, type, and attri-
        bute selectors. For the sake of expediency, I’ll group these together under
        the banner of DOM selectors. -->

        <!-- 

        DOM selectors are used to target and style elements in the HTML document based on their attributes, tags, or structure. These selectors operate directly on the elements and attributes in the DOM tree.
        Examples include:
        - Tag selectors (e.g., p, div) to select elements by their tag name.
        - Class selectors (e.g., .class-name) to select elements with a specific class.
        - ID selectors (e.g., #id-name) to select elements with a unique ID.
        - Attribute selectors (e.g., [type="text"]) to target elements with specific attributes or attribute values.
        -->


        <!-- 
        Pseudo-classes define the state or position of an element. They are used to style elements dynamically based on their interaction with the user or their relationship with other elements in the DOM.
        Examples include:
        - :hover (when the user hovers over an element)
        - :focus (when an element is focused)
        - :nth-child() (targeting specific children of a parent element)
        -->

        <!-- 
        Pseudo-elements style specific parts or portions of an element, such as its first letter, first line, or adding content before/after the element.
        Examples include:
        - ::before (adds content before an element)
        - ::after (adds content after an element)
        - ::first-letter (styles the first letter of an element)
        -->

        <!--
        attribute selectors target elements based on their HTML attributes like href, lang, rel, or others. Here’s a breakdown of the selectors described:
